## Overview

This script consolidates `indexes.conf` configurations from multiple Splunk apps into a single target app's `indexes.conf` file. It also excludes specific apps from this process, ensuring flexibility and avoiding unintentional changes to critical or development apps.

## Features

- Collects `indexes.conf` files from all apps (excluding specified ones) into a single `indexes.conf` file in a target app.
- Automatically creates a backup of the existing target `indexes.conf` file.
- Supports case-insensitive exclusion of apps.
- Renames old `indexes.conf` files in their respective apps to prevent duplication.
- Ensures the target directory exists before processing.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have sufficient permissions to execute scripts and modify files in the Splunk directory.
2. Identify the Splunk installation directory (`$SPLUNK_HOME`) and ensure it is correctly set in the script.
3. Define the target app where the consolidated `indexes.conf` will be stored.
4. Specify any apps to exclude from the consolidation process.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Modify the following variables in the script as needed:
     - `SPLUNK_HOME`: Path to the Splunk installation directory.
     - `TARGET_APP`: Name of the target app for the consolidated `indexes.conf`.
     - `EXCLUDE_APPS`: List of app names to exclude from processing.

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

3. **Post-Script Actions:**
   - Restart Splunk to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart
     ```

## Script Details

### Key Variables

- **`SPLUNK_HOME`**: Specifies the Splunk installation directory.
- **`TARGET_APP`**: The app where all `indexes.conf` configurations will be consolidated.
- **`EXCLUDE_APPS`**: A list of app names (case-insensitive) to exclude from processing.

### Key Functionalities

- **Create Target Directory**:
  Ensures the target app's `local` directory exists:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p "$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/$TARGET_APP/local"
  ```

- **Backup Existing Configurations**:
  Creates a timestamped backup of the target `indexes.conf` if it already exists:
  ```bash
  cp "$TARGET_CONF" "$TARGET_CONF.bak_$(date +%F_%T)"
  ```

- **Exclude Specific Apps**:
  Excludes apps listed in the `EXCLUDE_APPS` variable using case-insensitive matching.

- **Consolidate Configurations**:
  Collects and appends all `indexes.conf` files (excluding those from the target app or excluded apps) to the target app's `indexes.conf`.

- **Disable Old Configurations**:
  Renames old `indexes.conf` files to `indexes.conf.old` for safety.

### Logging

The script provides logging for key operations, such as:
- Skipping excluded apps.
- Copying configurations.
- Completing the consolidation process.

### Example Output
```plaintext
Skipping excluded app: run_app
Copying index configurations from /opt/splunk/etc/apps/app1/local/indexes.conf to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/my_indexes_app/local/indexes.conf
All applicable indexes moved to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/my_indexes_app/local/indexes.conf.
Please restart Splunk to apply changes.
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Ensure the script is executed with sufficient permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo ./script_name.sh
  ```
- **Missing Directory**: Verify that the `SPLUNK_HOME` variable is correctly set to the Splunk installation path.
- **Backup Issues**: Check if the target `indexes.conf` backup is successfully created.

## Disclaimer

This script modifies configuration files in Splunk. Review and test the script in a non-production environment before using it in production. Always maintain proper backups of your configurations.
